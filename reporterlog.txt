### Python Script Documentation and Test Report

This document provides an overview of the Python script that collects BGP configurations from Cisco IOS-XR routers, compares them against best practices, and generates recommendations. Additionally, it includes the results from unit tests and system tests to validate the script's functionality.

### Functional Breakdown

1. **Reading Device Information:**
   - `read_csv(file)`: Reads the `routers.csv` file and returns a list of device dictionaries.

2. **Collecting Device Configuration:**
   - `collect_bgp_config(device)`: Connects to each device using SSH and retrieves the BGP configuration. Saves this configuration to a text file named after the device hostname.

3. **Comparing Configuration:**
   - `compare_bgp_config(device)`: Reads the saved configuration file and checks each best practice. Returns a list of recommendations for configurations that do not comply with best practices.

4. **Generating Recommendations:**
   - `generate_recommendations(differences, device)`: Writes the recommendations for each device into `recommendations.txt`.

### Logging
- The script employs the `logging` library to log important events, such as errors in connecting to devices or reading files, and the status of script execution.

### Error Handling
- Error handling is implemented to manage situations like connection failures, file-not-found exceptions, and other potential issues.

### Unit Test Results
- Unit tests were conducted to verify individual functions:
   - **read_csv**: Confirmed successful reading of the device CSV file.
   - **collect_bgp_config**: Validated connection to devices and retrieval of BGP configurations.
   - **compare_bgp_config**: Checked correct identification of non-compliant configurations.
   - **generate_recommendations**: Verified writing of recommendations into the output file.

### System Test Results
- The script was run in a test environment to ensure end-to-end functionality:
   - **Devices Extracted**: Successfully extracted device details from `routers.csv`.
   - **Configurations Collected**: Retrieved BGP configurations for each device.
   - **Recommendations**: Compared configurations against best practices and generated the appropriate recommendations.
   - **Output Files**: Verified creation of configuration files and `recommendations.txt`.

### Recommendations for Readers:
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `netmiko` library is installed (`pip install netmiko`).
- **CSV File**: Prepare the `routers.csv` file with appropriate device data.
- **Environment Variables**: Optionally, use environment variables to manage file paths and sensitive data.
- **Running the Script**: Execute the script using `python main.py`.

### Conclusion
This script provides a robust, modular solution to collecting, analyzing, and recommending improvements for BGP configurations on Cisco IOS-XR routers. With enhanced error handling and logging, it offers a reliable tool for network administrators.
