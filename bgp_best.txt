There are two sets of rules for best practices: global and per neighbor.
Both sets must be checked.

** Global configuration rules (not per neighbor): 
G1: Synchronization is disabled
G2: Log neighbor changes
G3: Auto-summary is disabled
G4: BGP router ID uses one of the loopback addresses.

** Per neighbor configuration rules:
N1: Remove private AS in all external BGP configurations. 
N2: Enforce maximum number of prefixes received from a BGP neighbor
N3: Set next-hop-self for internal BGP neighboring sessions. 
N4: Enable BGP Time to Live (TTL) security check
N5: BGP neighbor authentication is configured with password or cryptography
N6: Neighbor filtering is configured with access list or filter list

** Note:
An external BGP neighbor is one that has a different AS number than the local router unless in a confederation.
An internal BGP neighbor is one that has the same AS number as the local router unless in a confederation.
